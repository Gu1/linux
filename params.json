{"name":"Linux for ODROID","tagline":"Linux kernel working on ODROID-U2, intended for server use and with emphasis on kernel security","body":"### Goal of the project\r\nAs you probably know if you own an [ODROID](http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G135341370451) device by the Korean company hardkernel, the kernel they officially support on their devices is rather old (3.0.y) is also oriented for a desktop usage..\r\n\r\nFor the these reasons, I've decided to maintain my own kernel for the ODROID (U2 only for now) with the goal of being as close as possible to mainline but without support for fancy features like 3D acceleration, HDMI, etc... Therefore, my kernel is clearly oriented for server use.\r\n\r\nThis project was started because I needed to be able to run a [grsecurity](http://grsecurity.net/)-enabled kernel on the ODROID-U2, so you should be able to apply the patch on top of my kernels.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
